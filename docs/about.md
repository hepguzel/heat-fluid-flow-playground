# About

**Heat & Fluid Flow Playground** is an open, educational project that turns core ideas of
**heat transfer** and **fluid mechanics** into small, visual, and interactive demos.

---

### ✨ Philosophy
Each demo isolates one concept — conduction, convection, or dimensionless numbers —
and lets you *see* equations at work, not just read them.  
Everything stays physically correct but visually intuitive.

---

### 💡 Motivation
Many learners struggle to connect equations with real thermal behavior.
This project bridges that gap by offering:

- concise notes written in engineering language,
- live sliders and color maps (Streamlit apps),
- and validation against analytical or textbook results.

---

### 🧰 Technology
Built with:
- **Python + Streamlit** for live demos,
- **MkDocs Material** for documentation,
- **KaTeX** for math rendering.

---

### 🛠️ Roadmap
Upcoming mini-apps will cover:
- Natural convection correlations,
- Forced convection boundary layers,
- Dimensionless numbers explorer.
